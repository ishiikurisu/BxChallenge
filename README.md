# BxBlue Challenge

> Create a system to identify if a pok√©mon trade is fair or not

About the challenge:

- The system should be available on Heroku and the source code, on GitHub.
- The [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) may be used to verify the stats.
- There should be a log with the trade history
- It is suggested to use the `base_experience` to verify fairness.

Progress is documented [here](./docs/notes.md).
